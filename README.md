# ðŸ§­ Path Finder

## SDG and Target
Our project, **Path Finder**, supports **SDG 4: Quality Education**, specifically **Target 4.4**, which aims to increase the number of youth with relevant skills for employment and future opportunities. Many senior high school students, especially in low-resource schools, struggle to choose the right college course due to limited access to personalized guidance. This often results in mismatched courses, dropouts, and wasted time and tuition. Path Finder uses AI-driven recommendations to match students with courses based on their hobbies, favorite subjects, and preferred work settings. By guiding students early toward suitable educational paths, the project promotes inclusive and equitable access to quality learning, empowering them to make confident, well-informed career decisions.

## Tech Stack
The **College Course Finder** program was created with a modern and efficient web technology stack. The frontend is developed using **Vite** and **React**, resulting in a dynamic and responsive interface where users may enter their hobbies, favorite subject, and desired work environment. **Firebase** is only needed to initialize and configure the AI model; it handles the API key and authentication settings that connect the web app to **Googleâ€™s AI services**. **Google Gemini** powers the AI integration, including the prompt and chatbot features, allowing the system to generate intelligent and personalized college course suggestions. Finally, the project is deployed on **Vercel**, which offers quick, dependable, and automated hosting for easy user access.

## Architecture
The architecture of **Path Finder** follows a simple yet effective clientâ€“AI interaction model. When a user enters their hobbies, favorite subject, and preferred work setting on the frontend, the data is collected through Reactâ€™s state management and sent to the AI module via Firebaseâ€™s secured API configuration. Firebase acts as the bridge between the web interface and Google Gemini, ensuring authenticated and reliable communication. Once the user inputs are transmitted, Gemini processes the prompt and generates personalized course recommendations based on the context and user preferences. The AIâ€™s response is then returned to the frontend, where it is dynamically rendered on the screen along with an optional chat interface for follow-up questions. This flow ensures seamless, real-time interaction and personalized guidance for each student.

## Biggest Challenge
Our biggest challenge was conceptualizing the right idea. At first, our team focused on creating a system to help students excel academically, such as tools for study improvement or performance tracking. However, through discussions and reflection, we realized that true academic success starts with choosing the right path. A student performs better when they are genuinely interested and passionate about what they study. This insight shifted our direction toward helping students discover the course that truly fits them. It was a turning point where we learned that motivation and performance naturally follow when you love what you do. From that realization, **Path Finder** was born: a platform that helps students align passion with purpose before college begins.
